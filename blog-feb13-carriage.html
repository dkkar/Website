    </h1>

    <p class="lead">Various interations of the carriage were designed. The first design can be seen below: </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4">
            <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-4" src="img/carriage1.PNG" alt="1st design">
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8 ">
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <p>The design to the left was first developed, with 3D printing in mind. We were hoping to manufacture the carriage using standard resin.
                As such, a FormLabs Form 2 3D  printer was booked in WatiMake. When time came to print however, it was noticed that the carriage exceeded the printer's size limits.
                ABS was ruled out as a material due to its weaker material properties and overall worse look than resin. Thus, another method of constructing 
                the carriage was needed. Lightness was greatly prioritised. We ended up going with manufacturing the carriage out of acrylic. 
                After manufacturing the current design out of acrylic and putting it together, it was noticed that the supports were rather week and had to be reinforced. 
              </p>
          </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">A second iteration for the carriage was produced based on the lessons learnt fromt he first. Here is the result:  </p>
    <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-4" src="img/carriage2.PNG" alt="2nd design">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-8 ">
            
            <p>Various improvements were made. Foremost, triangualar braces were added to the vertical supports, for additonal rigidity. this
              allowed the supports  to remain vertical and not cave in as in the previous design. Additionally, the support face itself was increased
              in size whilst more screw holes were added. The addition of these mounting holes allows for more flexibility when it comes to fastening the
              carriage to the final gimbal.
