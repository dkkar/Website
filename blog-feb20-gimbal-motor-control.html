                After initially testing the gimbal motors with the bidirectional ESCâ€™s purchased (left), it was clear that the
                 performance was not up to expectation. However, upon further research it was discovered that gimbal motors did not 
                 function too well with a regular BLDC ESC due to their construction. Thus, more suitable gimbal controller boards were
                  purchased to remedy this issue. These types of boards are capable of stabilizing a gimbal while receiving an input 
                  such that its direction can be changed. After receiving these boards in the mail and testing them with the motors, 
                  the motors were able to be better controlled. 
              </p>
          </ul>
        </div>

    <p class="lead">We then tried using 2-axis gimbal controllers:  </p>
    <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-4" src="img/gimbal_controller.jpg" alt="2nd design">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-8 ">
            
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the only available gimbal controller board (left) to be purchased under such short notice was designed for 
              2 axis drone applications. Thus, the third yaw axis is unable to be controlled. As such, a workaround is needed, as 
              the yaw axis is the most important in our application.Since the board can only stabilize in the pitch and roll axes, 
              the stabilization mechanism is disabled on a second board and the yaw axis is able to be controlled manually. Readings 
              from an IMU are fed to a controller in order to filter out disturbances.
