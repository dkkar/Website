              <p> All the parts for the gimbal were manufactured out of either PVC, acrylic or 3D printed resin. The colour choice for resin was
                black. As such, it made sense to paint the remaining members black as well to maintain unformity. The exact shade and finish of 
                black was still a question however. High shine gloss was chosen as it allowed the final product to appeal to the eye and catch the attention
                of others, due to the shine. The results after painting the PVC parts were very good. A concern however was the effect of the 
                spray paint on the acrylic parts as apparently, certain paints containing acetone may dissove acrylic. To avoid such a catastrophe, 
                the paint was first tested on a spare piece of acrylic for evidence of degradation. As no such evidence was found, the carriage and 
                other acrylic parts were painted as well. The 3D printed parts were not painted as they were already black in colour.
